# SkimLit

The purpose of this notebook is to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier.

The paper we're replicating (the source of the dataset we'll be using) is avaiable is: [PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071)

And reading through the paper above, we see that the model architecture that they use to achieve their best results is available here [Neural networks for joint sentence classification in medical paper abstracts.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251.pdf)

If you want to find the ground truth for this notebook (with lots of diagrams and text annotations) see the GitHub: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/09_SkimLit_nlp_milestone_project_2.ipynb
